# Terraform-CICD
CICD Jenkins+Ansible+Sonarqube+Docker.
user-data of all the servers are configured. The servers (Jenkins+Ansible+Sonarqube+Docker) are ready to go. 
commands.sh and commands_2.sh provide commands to ease the configuration.
Manual configuration between sonarqube and Jenkins, Jenkins and Ansible, Ansible and Docker still needs to be performed.
Good Luck!
